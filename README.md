#
#GPS and Image based campus navigation app (UTRGV-Brownsville Campus)
#
This work is a proof of concept of a navigation system for places where navigation between buildings or locations is not available on popular map apps (google,apple etc). 
#
We propose a community system where in users will create their custom maps and upload them to a central server.
#
A user clicks photos of landmark buildings and surrounding scenes while going between location A and location B.
#
We strip the GPS loc from these pics and then create a map from them in a single form/view. 
#
While the app is in use - the user recieves sound alerts / image alerts on his screen, as and when he/she is within (approaching) a certain distance from the landmark (20mtrs).
#
This was a group project and several features were identified to be worked on - Image Processing / Computer vision (automated landmark recognition - SIFT etc) . 
#
Alerts if the user strays off course etc.
